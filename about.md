Welcome. 

I'm Arian. Dancer, worker, brother, son, grandson, friend, lover, former, future, current, lasting. If I was born a century ago, I'd be a member of the intelligentsia. Two, and I'd be a priest. I think this is what I and someone I admire have in common. Anytime before that, I'd toil the hoe. Today, I toil the keyboard.

I'm a naši-speaker from Istria, a Balkan émigré, a German immigré, an absent Yugofuturist. But I live in Copenhagen where uncultured westerners just call me white when I speak English and Russian when I speak my tongue.

I'm interested in:
- Breaking as a practice and a subculture.
- Dancing and dance making in the context of theatre.
- The dance floor as an 'other' space in the tradition of David Mancuso.
- Forming bonds that last.
- Speaking of home over tranparent drinks.
- How to live a good life in a society seemingly intent on perpetuating a polycrisis.
- Islands.

If you wish to conspire with me, reach out.
